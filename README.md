## Overview

The OpenCTEM sensor (`openctemio-sensor`) is a lightweight, extensible security scanning sensor that integrates with the OpenCTEM platform. It supports multiple scanning tools and can run in various modes.

## Features

- **Multi-tool Support**: Semgrep, Trivy, Nuclei, Betterleaks, and more
- **SARIF Output**: Standard security results format
- **Flexible Modes**: One-shot, daemon, and standalone
- **CI/CD Integration**: Pre-built workflows for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI
- **Container Support**: Docker images for all supported tools

## Supported Tools

|------|----------|-------------|
| Semgrep | SAST | Static code analysis |
| Trivy | SCA/Container | Vulnerability scanning |
| Nuclei | DAST | Template-based scanning |
| Nuclei (validate) | Validation | Non-destructive re-verification of a finding's own template (CTEM Stage-4) |
| Betterleaks | Secrets | Secret detection |
| Naabu | Recon | Port scanning |
| Subfinder | Recon | Subdomain enumeration |
| HTTPx | Recon | HTTP probing |

| Katana | Recon | Web crawling |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# From source
git clone https://github.com/openctemio/sensor.git
cd agent
go build -o openctemio-sensor .

# Or download a release archive
curl -sSL https://github.com/openctemio/sensor/releases/download/<version>/openctemio-sensor_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
chmod +x openctemio-sensor
```

### Usage

#### One-shot Mode
```bash
# Run single scan and push results
./openctemio-sensor -tool semgrep -target ./src -push

# Run with specific tool
./openctemio-sensor -tool trivy -target ./

# Output to file
./openctemio-sensor -tool betterleaks -target ./ -output results.sarif
```

#### Daemon Mode
```bash
# Run as daemon, polling for jobs
./openctemio-sensor -daemon -config sensor.yaml
```

#### Standalone Mode
```bash
# Run locally without API connection
./openctemio-sensor -standalone -tool nuclei -target https://example.com
```

### Docker

Images are published as `ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:<version>-<variant>`
(and `latest-<variant>`). The `default` variant is also the plain tag:
`sensor:<version>` and `sensor:latest` (from v0.4.2; `-default` still works).

| Variant | Tools | Default command |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | semgrep, betterleaks, trivy, nuclei | `-daemon -enable-commands -verbose` (server-controlled sensor; runs and reports every installed tool, `SENSOR_TOOLS` optionally narrows them) |
| `ci` | semgrep, betterleaks, trivy | `--help` (pass a one-shot command) |
| `semgrep`, `betterleaks`, `trivy`, `nuclei` | that tool | `-tool <tool> --help` |

```bash
# Long-running sensor the platform dispatches scans to
docker run -d -e API_URL=https://<platform> -e API_KEY=<sensor key> \
  -v /srv/repos:/scan -v openctem-outbox:/var/lib/openctem/outbox \
  -v openctem-state:/var/lib/openctem/state -v openctem-content:/var/lib/openctem/content \
  ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:latest

# One scan: arguments replace the default command
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/scan ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:latest \
  -tool semgrep -target /scan

# Build locally
docker build -t openctemio/sensor .
```

A server-controlled daemon without `API_URL` or `API_KEY` exits with code 2
and names what is missing. Every image is smoke-tested before it is published
(`scripts/image-smoke-test.sh`): each bundled tool must run and
`openctemio-sensor -list-tools` must report it `available`.

#### Verifying images and releases

Release images are signed by digest with [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/)
keyless signing: the signature's certificate names this repository's
`docker-publish.yml` workflow at the release tag, issued from GitHub's OIDC
token. No long-lived signing key exists. Check an image before you run it:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:v0.6.0 \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity https://github.com/openctemio/sensor/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml@refs/tags/v0.6.0
```

Release archives: `checksums.txt` is signed the same way by `release.yml`
(`checksums.txt.sigstore.json`):

```bash
cosign verify-blob checksums.txt --bundle checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity https://github.com/openctemio/sensor/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v0.6.0
sha256sum -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

Images and archives published before signing was added carry no signature.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `API_URL` | Backend API base URL (or `-api-url` flag) | - |
| `API_KEY` | API authentication key (or `-api-key` flag) | - |
| `SENSOR_ID` | Sensor identifier (or `-sensor-id` flag) | auto |
| `SENSOR_TOOLS` | Optional allowlist: comma-separated scanners when `-tool`/`-tools` is not given. A server-controlled daemon without one runs every installed native scanner (semgrep, betterleaks, trivy, nuclei) and reports them to the platform | - (every installed tool) |
| `SENSOR_NAME` | Platform-mode sensor name (or `-name` flag) | auto |
| `SENSOR_MAX_JOBS` | Cap on commands run at once, 1-100 (or `-max-concurrent`, `sensor.max_jobs`); the live count follows CPU, memory and tool costs | no cap |
| `SENSOR_DRAIN_GRACE` | On SIGTERM, how long running scans may finish before they are stopped and handed back to the platform (allow it plus ~15 s in `stop_grace_period` / `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`) | `30s` |
| `SENSOR_STATE_DIR` | Local state: the renewed API key (`sensor-credentials.json`, see "API key renewal") and the tool cost history (`tool-costs.json`) | `/var/lib/openctem/state` when writable, else `~/.openctem` |
| `REGION` | Deployment region (or `-region` flag) | `default` |
| `SENSOR_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` | Set `1` to allow scanning RFC1918 / IPv6 ULA targets. IMDS / loopback / CGNAT stay blocked regardless. See [Scanner safety model](#scanner-safety-model). | off |
| `SENSOR_SCAN_ROOTS` | Directories (`:`-separated) that filesystem targets of dispatched code scans (betterleaks, semgrep, trivy fs) must resolve inside; a relative target is taken relative to the first. See [Scanner safety model](#scanner-safety-model). | the sensor's working directory (`/scan` in the images) |
| `SENSOR_TEMPLATE_SIGNING_KEYS` | The platform's template-signing public keys for this sensor's tenant (base64 Ed25519, comma-separated; from `GET /api/v1/scanner-templates/signing-key`). Custom templates in a scan run only with a signature one of them verifies. See [Nuclei template trust](#nuclei-template-trust-and-rate-limits). | none: scans with custom templates fail |
| `SENSOR_LOCAL_POLICY` | The sensor-local policy file (or `-local-policy`): targets, ports, tools, job types, custom templates, interactsh, rate and a kill switch, set by the network owner; jobs outside it are refused whatever the platform sends. A policy that cannot be loaded stops the sensor. See [Sensor-local policy](#sensor-local-policy). | `/etc/openctem/sensor-policy.yaml` when it exists, else none |
| `SENSOR_ALLOWED_RANGES` / `SENSOR_ALLOWED_PORTS` | Shorthand policy without a file: `targets.allow` (comma-separated CIDRs, IPs, names, `*.domain`) and `ports.allow` (`80,443,8000-8999`) | - |
| `SENSOR_KILL_SWITCH_FILE` | While this file exists the sensor runs no job and heartbeats "paused by local policy" (also `kill_switch_file` in the policy) | - |
| `SENSOR_NUCLEI_MAX_RATE_LIMIT` | Ceiling on nuclei requests per second (`-rate-limit`). A scan may ask for less, never more | `150` |
| `SENSOR_NUCLEI_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | Ceiling on nuclei templates in parallel (`-c`) | `25` |
| `SENSOR_NUCLEI_MAX_BULK_SIZE` | Ceiling on nuclei hosts in parallel per template (`-bs`) | `25` |

`API_URL`, `API_KEY` and `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` keep their names. The pre-rename
names `AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_NAME`, `AGENT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` and `-agent-id`
still work (see [Upgrading](#upgrading-from-the-agent-release)).

### Config File (sensor.yaml)

`-config` reads the keys of `Config` in `main.go`: `sensor:`, `server:`,
`outbox:`, `retry_queue:` (deprecated), `scanners:`, `collectors:` and
`targets:`.

```yaml
sensor:
  name: production-scanner
  region: default
  heartbeat_interval: 1m
  enable_commands: true
  command_poll_interval: 30s   # used only with an API without the heartbeat doorbell
  # disable_doorbell: true     # poll every command_poll_interval regardless
  # max_jobs: 8                # cap on commands run at once, 1-100 (SENSOR_MAX_JOBS); unset: follow CPU/memory

server:
  base_url: https://api.openctem.io
  api_key: ${API_KEY}
  sensor_id: your-sensor-id
  timeout: 30s
  protocol: auto               # auto | v1 | v2 (SENSOR_PROTOCOL)

outbox:                        # undelivered results; on by default with -daemon
  dir: /var/lib/openctem/outbox
  max_bytes: 1GiB
  max_age: 168h

scanners:
  - name: semgrep
    enabled: true
  - name: betterleaks
    enabled: true

targets:
  - /path/to/project
```

### Heartbeat doorbell

With an API that supports it (RFC-023 §9.2a) the daemon's heartbeat answer
says when there is work, and the daemon polls only then:

| Heartbeat answer | Sensor |
|---|---|
| `pending_jobs > 0` | polls for commands immediately |
| `next_heartbeat_seconds` | next heartbeat after that long (5 s – 5 min) |
| hints present | no fixed 30 s poll; a safety poll every 5 min |
| no hints (older API) | polls every `command_poll_interval`, as before |
| `pause` (sensor disabled) | takes no new jobs, running jobs finish, keeps heartbeating; logs `paused by platform`; resumes on the first heartbeat without `pause` |
| `drain` | like `pause`, until restart |
| `rotate_key` | renews the key now (when key auto-renewal is on, see "API key renewal"), saving it to the credentials file |
| `update`, unknown | logged only |

### API key renewal

The daemon keeps its state in `SENSOR_STATE_DIR` (default
`/var/lib/openctem/state` when writable, else `~/.openctem`). A key it
renews is saved there (`sensor-credentials.json`, 0600, written atomically)
and used on the next start instead of `API_KEY`, because the renewal retires
the key the sensor was installed with. If `API_KEY` is changed to a key an
administrator regenerated, the new `API_KEY` wins. A file an earlier version
kept in `~/.openctem` is moved into the state directory.

Auto-renewal (`PLATFORM_KEY_AUTORENEW`, `-key-autorenew`): `true` / `false`
force it; unset, it is **on when the state directory survives the container
being recreated** (outside a container always; inside one, only on a mounted
volume that is not a tmpfs) and off otherwise, with the reason in the start-up
log. **Mount a volume at `/var/lib/openctem/state`** (the platform's install
snippets do). The images create the directory but do not declare it a
`VOLUME`: an anonymous volume is lost with the container. The platform
issues expiring keys only when its `SENSOR_KEY_TTL` is set; with no TTL a
renewal (once, on the first start with renewal on) yields a key that never
expires and nothing else happens.

### Results delivery and the outbox

**Protocol.** The sensor speaks protocol v2 (`/api/v2/sensor/*`, api RFC-026
and RFC-029) for everything the platform offers: heartbeat, commands,
suppressions, fingerprint queries, key renewal and results. It asks the
platform once (`GET /api/v2/sensor/hello`) and uses protocol v1
(`/api/v1/agent/*`, deprecated by the platform) only for what an older
platform does not offer on v2, so it works with every platform version.
`SENSOR_PROTOCOL` / `-protocol` / `server.protocol` is `auto` (default), `v1`
(byte for byte the old requests) or `v2` (results must use v2; fails against a
platform without v2 results). On v2 the sensor is identified by its key alone.

**Outbox.** A daemon writes every result to its outbox **before** sending it
and deletes it only once the platform accepted it, so a crash, `kill -9`, an
API outage or a restart loses nothing; the backlog is sent, oldest first, as
soon as a heartbeat gets through. A command is reported complete only after
its results were accepted. Results the platform refuses for good (malformed,
tool not declared, ...) move to `dead/` with the reason instead of being
retried forever. The outbox never fills the disk: past the size or age cap the
oldest entries are dropped with a warning in the log, a metric and on the
heartbeat (the API stores it with the sensor).

| Setting | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `SENSOR_OUTBOX` (`outbox.enabled`) | `on` for `-daemon`, `off` for one-shot runs | `on` keeps a one-shot run's results for its next run |
| `SENSOR_OUTBOX_DIR` / `-outbox-dir` (`outbox.dir`) | `/var/lib/openctem/outbox`, else `~/.openctem/outbox` | **mount a persistent volume here** |
| `SENSOR_OUTBOX_MAX_BYTES` (`outbox.max_bytes`) | `1GiB` (and at most half of the free space) | e.g. `512MiB` |
| `SENSOR_OUTBOX_MAX_AGE` (`outbox.max_age`) | `168h` | |
| `SENSOR_OUTBOX_KEY_FILE` (`outbox.key_file`) | `<dir>/outbox.key` | the AES-256-GCM key, created on first start; point it at a mounted secret to keep it off the data volume |

Files are 0600 in a 0700 directory and encrypted; one sensor process per
directory (a second one refuses to start). While the sensor runs, its
heartbeat reports the outbox state to the platform (pending results, oldest
age, dead letters, evictions). With the sensor stopped:

```bash
openctemio-sensor -outbox-status            # pending, dead letters with reasons
openctemio-sensor -outbox-requeue-dead      # after fixing the cause; the next start delivers them
# in Docker, against the same volume:
docker run --rm -v openctem-outbox:/var/lib/openctem/outbox ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:latest -outbox-status
```

Upgrading: the old `-retry-queue` / `RETRY_QUEUE=true` now turns the outbox on
(also for one-shot runs), and results an older sensor left in its retry-queue
directory (`RETRY_DIR`, default `~/.openctem/retry-queue`) are imported once.

### Rejected key and connection failures

The daemon checks its key with its first heartbeat. When the platform rejects
it (HTTP 401/403: the key is wrong, revoked, expired or regenerated, or the
sensor was deleted), the daemon **stays up**: it stops polling for jobs and
checks again after 30 s, doubling to at most 10 min. It logs one line per
attempt, without `-verbose`:

```
[connection] the platform rejected the API key (HTTP 401, key rda_5d22…): ... Create or regenerate a key under Settings → Sensors, set API_KEY to it and restart the sensor. Not polling for jobs; next check in 30s (attempt 1)
```

It carries on by itself once the key is accepted again, for example after
the sensor is re-activated. A 401 `API key required` means the key never
reached the API: `API_URL` points at the web UI or at a proxy that strips
the `Authorization` header. Network failures are logged at 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
consecutive attempts, along with the recovery.

A one-shot run (`-push` without `-daemon`, e.g. in CI) exits with code
**78** (`EX_CONFIG`) when its key is rejected, so the job fails with that
message rather than a generic error.

Restart policy: the daemon no longer exits on a rejected key, so
`restart: unless-stopped` / Kubernetes `restartPolicy: Always` cannot turn
it into a restart loop. Don't treat exit code 78 as transient in wrappers
that retry one-shot runs.

## Scanner content updates

A scanner binary is pinned and checksum-verified in the image; the **content**
it scans with changes daily. In daemon mode the sensor manages that content
itself, so scans use a known, verified version instead of whatever a tool
fetches mid-scan:

| Content | Tool | Default source | Verification | Managed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trivy-db` | trivy | `mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-db:2`, then `ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2` | manifest digest resolved first and downloaded by digest (trivy verifies every blob); `trivy version` must read schema 2; never older than the installed DB unless pinned | always |
| `trivy-java-db` | trivy | trivy's default | trivy reads its metadata | `SENSOR_CONTENT_TRIVY_JAVA_DB=true` (about 800 MB more) |
| `nuclei-templates` | nuclei | the GitHub release (`releases/latest`) | archive sha256 against the release's `_checksums.txt`; safe extraction; at least 1000 templates that nuclei loads; scans run with `-disable-unsigned-templates` (signature check) and `-disable-update-check` | always |
| `semgrep-rules` | semgrep | `https://semgrep.dev/c/<ruleset>` | YAML check (rules with ids) and semgrep loads the bundle | only when rulesets are chosen (platform policy or `SENSOR_CONTENT_SEMGREP_RULESETS`) or a local rules path is set; otherwise semgrep keeps `--config auto` and the sensor reports that as unmanaged |

How it works: every refresh downloads into a staging directory, verifies,
and only then switches the `current` link atomically. A failed download or
check keeps the current version and is reported. A running scan keeps the
version it started with; the previous version is kept for rollback. Checks
run every 6 hours (±10% jitter, hourly while content is missing, stale or
failing) and on demand when the platform sends a `refresh_content` command
("Refresh content" on the Sensors page). The heartbeat reports each tool's
content (`tools[].content`: version, build time, source, digest, last error)
and each result carries the content its scan used (`tool.properties.content`).

The platform's content policy can set the refresh interval, a maximum age,
a pinned version (a trivy DB digest, a nuclei-templates tag) and semgrep
rulesets. **It can never choose where content comes from**: sources are only
this host's settings below.

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `SENSOR_CONTENT` | `on` | `off`: tools fetch their own content, as before |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_DIR` | `$HOME/.openctem/content` (`/var/lib/openctem/content` in the images) | mount a volume here |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | `6h` | 10m..720h; the policy may override |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_KEEP` | `1` | previous versions kept for rollback (0..10) |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_TRIVY_DB_REPOSITORY` | see above | comma list, tried in order; registry credentials from `TRIVY_USERNAME`/`TRIVY_PASSWORD` |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_TRIVY_JAVA_DB` / `_REPOSITORY` | off / trivy default | |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_URL` | GitHub archive | `{version}` / `{bare_version}` placeholders; `https://` or a local file |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_CHECKSUMS_URL` | GitHub release asset | required with a mirror unless `_SHA256` is set |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_LATEST_URL` | GitHub API (only with the default archive URL) | GitHub-shaped JSON or a plain-text tag |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_VERSION` / `_SHA256` | none | pin a release / its archive digest |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_DIR` | none | a local template directory, installed as is |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_MIN_TEMPLATES` | `1000` | |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_SEMGREP_RULESETS` | none | e.g. `p/default,p/secrets` |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_SEMGREP_REGISTRY_URL` | `https://semgrep.dev` | a registry mirror |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_SEMGREP_RULES_PATH` | none | a local rules file or directory |
| `SENSOR_CONTENT_SEMGREP_SKIP_CHECK` | off | skip the semgrep load check (~1 min for `p/default`) |

`openctemio-sensor -content-status` prints what is installed;
`-content-refresh` (with `-content-force` to re-download) refreshes now, for
example from cron on a host that runs one-shot scans (one-shot runs use
installed content but never download it).

**Air-gapped hosts:**

- trivy DB: copy the artifact into an internal registry
  (`oras copy mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-db:2 harbor.internal/aquasec/trivy-db:2`)
  and set `SENSOR_CONTENT_TRIVY_DB_REPOSITORY=harbor.internal/aquasec/trivy-db:2`.
- nuclei templates: put `nuclei-templates-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` and the release's
  `nuclei-templates-X.Y.Z_checksums.txt` on an internal web server or a
  mounted directory, set `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_URL=file:///mirror/nuclei-templates-{version}.tar.gz`,
  `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_CHECKSUMS_URL=file:///mirror/nuclei-templates-{bare_version}_checksums.txt`
  and pin the version (policy or `SENSOR_CONTENT_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_VERSION`).
- semgrep: `SENSOR_CONTENT_SEMGREP_RULES_PATH=/mirror/semgrep-rules.yaml`.

**Disk:** about 1.5 GB per trivy DB version (two with the default
`SENSOR_CONTENT_KEEP=1`, plus 0.8 GB each with the Java DB), about 150 MB per
nuclei-templates version, a few MB of semgrep rules.

## Validation (CTEM Stage-4)

Beyond one-shot scanning, the daemon can **re-verify existing findings** so the
platform can confirm-or-downgrade them without a full rescan.

- **`validate`** — advertised **always**. The daemon wraps its command executor
  with a validating executor that runs a non-intrusive TCP-reachability
  safe-check for `validate` commands, regardless of which scanners are enabled
  (`runDaemon` in `main.go`).
- **`validate:nuclei`** — advertised when the vuln-scan (nuclei) image is present
  It re-runs a finding's **own** detection template
  non-destructively and returns `detected` / `not_detected` / `inconclusive` /
  `error` (`internal/executor/validation.go` `RunNucleiValidate`). If the
  template is not installed, the result is `inconclusive` — never a false
  downgrade.

## Sensor-local policy

The owner of the scanned network sets what this sensor may do, in a
read-only file the platform cannot change (api RFC-040 §5.7):
[`docs/LOCAL_POLICY.md`](docs/LOCAL_POLICY.md), template
[`docs/sensor-policy.example.yaml`](docs/sensor-policy.example.yaml).

```bash
install -o root -g root -m 0644 docs/sensor-policy.example.yaml /etc/openctem/sensor-policy.yaml   # then edit it
docker run … -v /etc/openctem:/etc/openctem:ro ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:<tag> -daemon -enable-commands
touch /etc/openctem/STOP   # kill switch: no job runs until the file is removed
```

Every job is checked after the claim and before any tool runs: its targets
(host names resolved, every address checked), ports, tool, job type, custom
templates and interactsh. A refused job is reported failed with
`refused by local policy: <rule>: <detail>`. Rate and run time are capped.
A malformed policy stops the sensor. Without a policy the sensor works as
before, reports `local_policy: absent` and logs warnings; custom templates
and interactsh are off in any policy unless it turns them on.

## Scanner safety model

Scan and validation targets originate from ingested asset data, so every target
passes an SSRF guard before any tool runs
(`internal/executor/target_security.go`):

- **Hard-blocked, never openable:** cloud metadata / link-local
  (`169.254.0.0/16`, incl. IMDS `169.254.169.254`), loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`,
  `::1`), and carrier-grade NAT (`100.64.0.0/10`), plus multicast/broadcast.
- **Blocked by default, opt-in:** RFC1918 / IPv6 ULA private space
  (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`). Set
  `SENSOR_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=1` to scan on-prem/internal targets. IMDS,
  loopback, and CGNAT stay blocked regardless.

Targets are checked according to the scanner that receives them. Network
scanners (nuclei, the recon tools, and any scanner the sensor does not know)
get the SSRF guard above. Code scanners (betterleaks, semgrep, trivy fs/config)
take a directory: it must resolve, symlinks followed, inside the scan
workspace (`SENSOR_SCAN_ROOTS`, default the working directory), and never a
sensitive host path (`/etc`, `~/.ssh`, ...). A remote repository URL given to a
code scanner is SSRF-guarded like any network target.

A daemon with `-enable-commands` scans only what the server dispatches. It
runs scheduled scans of its own only for targets you configure explicitly
(`-target`, or `targets:` in the config file).

Additional guards on the vuln-scan path:

- **Dangerous-flag blocklist** (sdk-go `core.ValidateExtraArgs`, CWE-77) — rejects
  user-supplied tool flags that redirect output, set a proxy, load an
  attacker-controlled target list / rule / template file, enable the code,
  file, self-contained or headless template types, switch template signature
  checks off, upload results to a third party, or override resolvers /
  interface / source IP. Rate-limit flags are refused too (see below).
- **Nuclei re-verify is detection-only** — the `dos`, `fuzz`, `intrusive`, and
  `brute-force` template tags are excluded, the template must have a safe
  matcher, runs are bounded by timeout and rate-limited per asset, and every run
  is logged under its command id (the audit key).

### Nuclei template trust and rate limits

The sensor's own nuclei templates (the managed `nuclei-templates` release,
or the templates baked into the image) always run with
`-disable-unsigned-templates`: nuclei skips any template whose
ProjectDiscovery signature is missing or does not match. The code protocol
is never enabled: the sensor never passes `-code`, `-file`, `-esc` or
`-dast`, passes `-headless` only when configured in code, and refuses all of
them (and `-dut=false`) in extra args.

Custom templates (uploaded by a tenant admin on the platform) are not signed
by ProjectDiscovery, so they are trusted another way:

1. The platform refuses, at upload, templates that use the `code`,
   `javascript`, `headless` or `file` protocol or are self-contained.
2. When it hands a command to a sensor, the platform validates every
   template again and signs one manifest of the set (tenant, this sensor,
   this command, issue and expiry time, and the id, name, type and SHA-256
   of each template) in a DSSE envelope with an Ed25519 key derived for the
   tenant. The sensor (sdk-go) verifies the envelope against
   `SENSOR_TEMPLATE_SIGNING_KEYS` before parsing it, then refuses a manifest
   for another command (or another sensor, when `SENSOR_ID` is set), an
   expired one, and any template changed, added, held back or reordered.
   Without a pinned key, scans with custom templates fail.
3. The sensor checks the templates itself again (`CheckCustomTemplates`):
   the same protocols and self-contained templates are refused.
4. Custom templates run in their own nuclei run, with
   `-exclude-type code,file,headless,javascript` and never `-headless`;
   the sensor's own templates run before them, still with
   `-disable-unsigned-templates`. The scan's results are both runs'.

Pin the key once per sensor:

```bash
# On the platform, as a tenant admin:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://platform/api/v1/scanner-templates/signing-key
# -> {"algorithm":"ed25519","key_id":"…","public_key":"<base64>"}
docker run … -e SENSOR_TEMPLATE_SIGNING_KEYS=<base64> ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:<tag>
```

To roll the platform key, pin the new key next to the old one
(comma-separated), rotate on the platform, then drop the old one.

**Rate limits.** nuclei always gets `-rate-limit`, `-c` and `-bs`. A scan
command may ask for lower values (config `rate_limit`, `concurrency`,
`bulk_size`); the sensor uses them up to the ceilings
`SENSOR_NUCLEI_MAX_RATE_LIMIT` / `_CONCURRENCY` / `_BULK_SIZE` (default
150 / 25 / 25, nuclei's own defaults) and never above. A value outside
1..1000000 stops the sensor at start. Rate-limit flags in extra args
(`-rate-limit`, `-bs`, `-c`, `-per-host-rate-limit`, ...) are refused.
Re-verification (`validate:nuclei`) runs at 20 requests per second, or the
ceiling when it is lower.

## Upgrading from the agent release

The binary, images and settings were renamed from *agent* to *sensor*
([RFC-023 §9.5](https://github.com/openctemio/openctem/blob/main/api/docs/rfcs/RFC-023-scan-zones-and-scanners.md)).
A sensor upgraded in place keeps working with its existing configuration:

| Before | After | On upgrade |
|---|---|---|
| binary `agent` | `openctemio-sensor` | — |
| image `ghcr.io/openctemio/agent:<tag>` | `ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:<tag>` | old tags stay pullable and frozen (never updated, never deleted) |
| `AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_NAME`, `AGENT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` | `SENSOR_ID`, `SENSOR_NAME`, `SENSOR_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` | old name applied, startup warning naming both |
| `-agent-id` | `-sensor-id` | old flag applied, startup warning |
| config `agent:` block, `server.agent_id` | `sensor:`, `server.sensor_id` | old keys applied, startup warning |
| `~/.openctem/agent-credentials.json` | `~/.openctem/sensor-credentials.json` | moved on first start (written 0600 and read back before the old file is removed); same identity and key, no re-registration. If the file cannot be moved (read-only mount) it is used in place. `-credentials <path>` is used as is. |
| `API_URL`, `API_KEY`, `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` | unchanged | — |

The sensor refuses to start only when an old and a new name are both set to
**different** values; the error names both (never the values). The sensor
negotiates the protocol with the platform (v2 where offered, v1 otherwise), so
an upgraded sensor works with any platform version.

## Upgrading: gitleaks → Betterleaks

[Betterleaks](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks) replaces gitleaks as
the secret scanner. It is gitleaks' successor by its original author (MIT): v1
keeps gitleaks' CLI flags, config format and JSON report, and adds BPE-token
filtering, Expr rule filters and validation, recursive decoding and scanning
inside archives (on by default).

- The image is `ghcr.io/openctemio/sensor:<version>-betterleaks`. No
  `-gitleaks` image is published from this release on; existing `-gitleaks`
  tags stay pullable and frozen.
- The scanner is `betterleaks` (`-tool betterleaks`, `SENSOR_TOOLS`,
  `scanners: - name: betterleaks`). `gitleaks` in an existing command line,
  config or CI template still works: it runs betterleaks and prints a note.
  A platform that has not migrated its scan configs and still dispatches
  `gitleaks` scans is handled the same way.
- `.gitleaks.toml` custom rules keep working (betterleaks reads them;
  `.betterleaks.toml` is the new name).
- Findings keep their identity: a secret both tools report has the same
  fingerprint, so existing findings are updated, not duplicated. Rule sets
  differ, for example betterleaks reports an AWS access key ID only together
  with its secret key, so a few gitleaks-only findings are auto-resolved by
  the first full betterleaks scan, and archives produce new ones.
- Upgrade every sensor that scans a repository together: a gitleaks sensor
  and a betterleaks sensor on the same repository resolve and reopen each
  other's rule-set differences.
- The platform maps reports from older sensors (`tool: gitleaks`) to
  `betterleaks` at ingest and migrates scan configs and existing findings
  (API migration 000241).
